Observations of graphs

Best/worst case of insertionSort:
-The worst case of insertionsort grows fairly exponentially in comparison to the best case
-As n increases, the time required to sort also does

-The best case stays fairly constant throught each run
-Minimal change with an increase in n

Best/worst case of mergeSort
-Both the best and worst case for mergesort are roughly equivalent
-The function remains nlog(n) for both cases
-As n increases the time increases increases linearly for small n


Average case of insertionSort:
- In the average case the time behaves similarly to the worst case
- The graph appears to be exponential for the time taken to sort the array

Average case of mergeSort:
- Again, the function mimicks both the best and worst case scenarios of n
- Time appears linear due to the lack or large n
