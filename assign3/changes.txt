Changes:
	To start we removed the num_balls x num_balls array and the two wall 1D arrays.
	That meant that instead of updating those arrays we directly inserted values 
	into our priority queue. This meant that there needed to be a function 
	that when something was inserted at the back of the min_heap, it brought it to its
	correct position to maintain the heap property.  To combat this we created the
	function heap_increase_key.  We also implemented a delete function, which used the 
	very important heapify function.  There was also a slew of helper functions we 
	implemented to make the code run a little bit smoother and be slighlty more
	effcient.
