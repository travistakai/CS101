Observations
	Initializing takes much less time for the priority queue, and the priority queue
	definitly is more effecient inserting values, but for balls all the way up to 100 
	it seemed like the priority queue and the array based data structure lagged evenly. 
	When there was a break in ball collisions when num_balls was smaller, it seemed like 
	the priority queue sped up much quicker and was able to get_next values much quicker.
