# CS101
The aim of the course is to study basic algorithms and their relationships to common abstract data types. We will cover the notion of abstract data types and the distinction between an abstract data type and an implementation of that data type. The complexity analysis of common algorithms using asymptotic (big "O") notation will emphasized. Topics include (but not limited to) sorting, searching, basic graph algorithms, as well as algorithm design and analysis. Abstract data types covered include priority queues, dictionaries, disjoint sets, heaps, balanced trees, and hashing. Familiarity with Python and Unix is assumed.
